# Class INFO
Data and Visual Analytics Section 01 Fall Semester 2023 CO

This is a detailed description of what we did, what results we obtained, and what we have learned and/or can conclude from our work.

# Components:

- Writeup: fewer than 2800 words, 12pt font, typed. Describe in depth the novelties of your approach and your     discoveries/insights/experiments, etc.  

- Software: packaging, documentation, and portability. The goal is to provide enough material so that other people can use it and continue your work if you are to open-source it -- in other words, you should make it easy and attractive for others to use your work.

# Grading scheme & Submission instructions

- Writeup
[2%] Introduction - Motivation

[3%] Problem definition

[5%] Survey

- Proposed method
  
[10%] Intuition - why should it be better than the state of the art?

[35%] Description of your approaches: algorithms, user interfaces, etc.

- Experiments/ Evaluation
  
[5%] Description of your testbed; list of questions your experiments are designed to answer

[25%] Details of the experiments; observations (as many as you can!)

[5%] Conclusions and discussion

[-5% if not included] Distribution of team member effort. Can be as simple as "all team member contributes a similar amount of effort". If effort distribution is too uneven, I may assign higher scores to members who contributed more.

[10%] Team’s contact person submits one zip file, called teamXXfinal.zip, via D2L, where XX is the team number (e.g., team01final.zip for team 1). 

- The teamXXfinal.zip will contain the following 3 components:

README.txt - a concise, short README.txt file, corresponding to the "user guide".

- This file should contain:
  
DESCRIPTION - Describe the package in a few paragraphs.

INSTALLATION - How to install and setup your code.

EXECUTION - How to run a demo on your code.

DOC - a folder called DOC (short for “documentation”) containing:

teamXXreport.pdf - Your report writeup in PDF format (can be created using any software, e.g., latex, Word)

teamXXposter.pdf - Your final poster. (if any)

CODE - All your code should be added here. Make sure that your package includes only the absolutely necessary set of files.


# DATA

Should datasets be included as part of our submission?

If you are referring to (small) toy data for a demo (that we/TAs will run), you are welcome to include them. Think about the open-source software libraries that you have seen or have used, they would often include some sort of "quick start" guide to get a demo running on a toy dataset.


For large datasets, please do not include them; if the dataset is public and can be easily downloaded, include the link to the dataset.

If getting a dataset requires writing scripts/programs, include those scripts, and write down the steps that people will need to go through (e.g., register for an account to get API key).

If you have processed the dataset in some ways, including the code you used, and the steps people will need to go through.
