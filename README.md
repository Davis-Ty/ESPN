# ESPN Data and Visual Analytics
# DESCRIPTION 

The football analytics dashboard sources its data from a CSV file named "defense.csv," encompassing diverse defensive metrics across various college football teams. With a visually engaging dark-themed layout, the dashboard features a navigation bar housing links to "About" and "Contact" sections. The main dashboard section, titled "2023 Football Defensive Stats," showcases a variety of charts for visualizing defensive statistics.

Among the primary charts, the stacked bar chart (id='allD-chart') presents aggregated defensive statistics for different college football teams, with interactive capabilities for potential data filtering based on the x-axis range. The scatter chart (id='football-chart') employs football symbols ('üèà') to represent each team, symbol size dynamically reflecting corresponding defensive statistic values. The radar chart (id='radar-chart') facilitates the comparison of selected defensive metrics for two chosen teams through polygons, illustrating performance across various defensive categories.

The dashboard offers interactive controls, including dropdowns and sliders for users to select defensive statistic categories and compare teams. A slider enables users to adjust a threshold value, filtering teams based on the chosen defensive statistic. Team selection dropdowns empower users to choose two teams for direct defensive performance comparison.

Additionally, the application incorporates hidden charts (Passing, Running, Sack, Score, Total, Total Histogram) that become visible upon users selecting two teams, providing detailed insights into specific facets of the game.

Thematically, the application employs football-inspired colors, utilizing green for the background, yellow for text, and random colors for charts. The navigation bar includes external links to web pages offering additional information under "About" and "Contact."
